## DSA: Analysis and Design

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in the projects of this course was determining the best data structure that would result in the best runtime and storage space given performance and resource contraints. In order to gain more insight as to which data structure would be best for a given situation, the class dove into vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees and studied the Big-O notation pertaining to each data structure. Gaining a deep understanding of the subject would arm a software developer to determine what is most efficient for the given tasks.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by determining the use case of the project â€“ whether it be for a video game(requires fast runtime), or a scheduling service(requires reasonable runtime). I then make a decision of of what data structure would the best medium between simplicity and efficiency. Data structures is important to understand because without a deep grasp of the subject, a company could potentially be running inefficiently and less cost effectively, which could cost both time and money in the long run.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame roadblocks by always referring to the ZyBooks reference material and online references such as stackoverflow and good ol' Google web search. Since this class is covering the topic of data structures, I needed to go back several times to review basic syntax and OOP principles on occasion. Nonetheless, this class was an eye opener as to what would be required for a technical interview. Of course, I would need a lot more time to study this material more indepth.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work I completed on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by learning about the binary tree data structure and delving deeper into linked lists, vectors, and dictionaries that was briefly covered in my previous classes. I feel more comfortable and confident with implementing the various data structures for any given scenario; at this point I just need more Leetcode practice.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project evolved the way how I write programs that are maintainable readable and adaptable by preserving my OOP and industry best practices. I have also learned to write better comments and keeping syntax clean so that when I return to the code in the future, I am less likely to be lost from where I left off.
